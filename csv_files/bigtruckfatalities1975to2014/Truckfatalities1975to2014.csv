"Notes: A large truck is defined as a truck with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 10,000 pounds. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) implemented an enhanced methodology for estimating registered vehicles and vehicle miles traveled by vehicle type beginning with data from 2007. As a result, involvement rates may differ, and in some cases significantly, from earlier years.",,,,,,,,,
