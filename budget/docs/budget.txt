=======================================================
django-budget: A simple personal budgeting application.
=======================================================

```django-budget``` is a simple budgeting application for use with Django. It 
is designed to manage personal finances. We used it to replace a complicated 
Excel spreadsheet that didn't retain all the details we wanted.

It was implemented in Django based on familiarity, quick time to implement 
and the premise that it could be accessible everywhere. In practice, we run 
this locally (NOT on a publicly accessible website).


A Note About Security
=====================

It is recommended that anyone using this application add further security by 
either protecting the whole app with HTTP Auth, wrap the views with the
```login-required``` decorator, run it on a local machine or implement similar
protections. This application is for your use and makes no assumptions about 
how viewable the data is to other people.


Requirements
============

```django-budget``` requires Python 2.3 or better and Django 1.0 or better.


Installation
============

#. Either copy/symlink the ```budget``` app into your project or place it somewhere on your ```PYTHONPATH```.
